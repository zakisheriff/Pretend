## 🎮 Game Modes

Pretend features **8 distinct ways to play**, all optimized for a single-phone "pass and play" experience:

### 2+ Players

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🎭 **Charades** | Classic act-it-out game! Tilt phone down for correct, up to pass. Device motion controls. |
| 🎬 **Director's Cut** | One player is the Director who knows the movie. Others ask yes/no questions to guess. |
| 💣 **Time Bomb** | Quick-fire word association under pressure. Don't be the one holding the bomb! |
| 🌊 **Wavelength** | A telepathy game! A Psychic gives a clue to a target on a spectrum. Players discuss and dial in the perfect position. |

### 3+ Players

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🕵️ **Classic Imposter** | Crewmates get a secret word, Imposter gets a vague clue. Find the impostor! |
| 🔍 **Undercover** | Everyone gets a word, but one player has a slightly different word. Spot the difference! |
| 🧠 **Mind Sync** | Everyone answers a question, but one player got a different question. Find the outlier! |

### 4+ Players

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🚨 **Thief & Police** | One Police, one Thief, rest are Civilians. Police & Civilians get the same word, Thief gets a different one. Police must identify the Thief! |

---

## 🚨 NEW: Thief & Police Mode

A unique social deduction game requiring 4+ players:

**Roles:**
- **Police** (1 player) - Gets the crewmate word, must find the Thief
- **Thief** (1 player) - Gets a different but related word, must blend in
- **Civilians** (remaining players) - Get the same word as Police, help catch the Thief

**Flow:**
1. Each player sees their role (Police/Thief/Civilian) and their word
2. 5-minute discussion with clues
3. Police makes the arrest decision
4. Instant reveal: Caught or Escaped!

**Scoring:**
| Outcome | Police | Thief | Civilians |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Thief Caught | +1 | 0 | +1 each |
| Thief Escaped | 0 | +2 | 0 |

## 🌊 NEW: Wavelength Mode

A cooperative game of telepathy and empathy for 2+ players:

**How it Works:**
1. **The Psychic** sees a target position on a spectrum (e.g., Hot vs Cold).
2. They give a **one-word clue** that fits that specific position.
3. **The Guessers** discuss and turn the dial to where they think the target is.
4. **Reveal!** Score points based on how close users got to the bullseye.
